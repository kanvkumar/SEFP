I think that Use Cases is better for the developers to understand since it depicts the features in a more precise way as compared to SRS as it is quite detailed and thus takes time for the developers to actually find the features they need to implement.

From the end user's perspective, I think that the SRS will be more meaningfull since the user can know each and every detail of the software built.

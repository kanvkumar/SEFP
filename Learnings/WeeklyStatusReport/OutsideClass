#2 Realised the importance of software engineering in the industry. I tried to search technolgies widely used by the programmers for building applications.

Week 2:

We discussed about our team project with all the team members and decided the technologies that we would be using for our team project, features to be implemented, starting point for the project.

Week 3:

Formation of FB Brainstorming pages, discussion with T.A's and Sridhar Sir regading project proposal, submitting proposals, documentation, elevator pitch etc.

 #2 Understood them and made SRS, user stories and use cases for my Passion Project and also the Team Project.
 #3 Developed a rationale for deciding which one is better for the project (both Passion and Team) and studied the

Week 6:
 #1 Understood 4 types of software design approaches like:

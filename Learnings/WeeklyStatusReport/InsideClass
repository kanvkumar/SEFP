Week1:

#1 Learnt life cycles which exists while developing an application like Requirements phase, Specification phase, design phase, Implementation phase and testing phase
Also learnt about Agile Methods like ASD(Adaptive Software Development),crystal, FDD (Feature Driven Development), Classic Waterfall method.

#2 Design of Candy Crush Saga taught how to work as a team and how to think effectively while designing the application, challenges of software engineering, roles of software engineering, differences between programming and software engineering, and realised that software engineering is not equal to coding.

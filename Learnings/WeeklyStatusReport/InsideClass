What you learnt inside the class?
Week1:

#1 Learnt life cycles which exists while developing an application like Requirements phase, Specification phase, design phase, Implementation phase and testing phase
Also learnt about Agile Methods like ASD(Adaptive Software Development),crystal, FDD (Feature Driven Development), Classic Waterfall method.

#2 Design of Candy Crush Saga taught how to work as a team and how to think effectively while designing the application, challenges of software engineering, roles of software engineering, differences between programming and software engineering, and realised that software engineering is not equal to coding.


Week 2:

#1 Learnt about Agile Methodolgy like:
   a) Simplicity: creating the simplest thing that could work.
   b) communication: face-to-face, documentation not face-to-face.
   c) Feedback: lots of tests.
   d) Agressiveness.

#2 12 practices:
   1) The Planning game       5) Testing
   2)  Small releases         6) Refactoring
   3)  Metaphor               7) Pair Programming
   4) Simple design           8) Collective Ownership
   9) 40-hour/weak            10) On-site customer
   11) Coding standards       12) Continuos integrations

Week 3:

#1 Learnt about functional and non-functional requirements. Functional requirements are the key features in while designing any product and should also choose our stakeholders.

#2 Learnt about use cases, UML diagrams, class diagrams.

#3 Also learnt about Requirements engineering(RE). It is not only software engineering alone as requirements play a vital role in building software. 

Week 4:

# 1.Zachman framework:
   It is a fundamental structure for Enterprise Architecture which provides a formal and structured way of viewing and defining an enterprise.It is a  framework to organize and analyze data,a two-dimensional schema, used to organize the detailed representations of the enterprise.
   The Zachman Framework is not a methodology in that it does not imply any specific method or process for collecting, managing, or using the information that it describes.It is an ontology whereby a schema for organizing architectural artifacts.
     
# 2.Agile modeling:
   It believes that every project needs to be handled differently and the existing methods need to be tailored to best suit the project requirements. In agile the tasks are divided to time boxes  to deliver specific features for a release.
             
# 3.Demings philosophy:
   Create constancy of purpose toward improvement of product and service, with the aim to become competitive and to stay in business, and to provide jobs.

Week 5:
Learnt about how to do documentation using SRS (Software Requirement Specifications) which primarily focusses on Functional
Requirements, Non-Functional Requirements, Scope of the product being developed, and Goals of Implementation.

Week 6:
#1 Learnt about software design life cycle which includes Synthesize, Analyse, Evaluate as its main components.
#2 Also learnt about the 7 problems that a software designer faces: 
   1) People:Prediction
   2) TradeOffs:: quantity
   3) Change
   4) Bias
   5) Longetivity: Legacy
   6) Quality, Cost and effort
   7) Source Code as a design notation.
 
 #3 Different types of notations followed in software engineering like formal notation, informal notation, Semi-formal
    notation, No Notation.
